# Bike Analysis
The purpose of this analysis is to determine if rental bike stations would be profitable in other states by breaking down users by gender and reviewing the analysis of times the bikes are in use.

## Gender Breakdown
First, we start by breaking down riders by gender and determining the best times of day by rider. Additionally, we break down subscribers by gender and weekday usage to get an accurate point of reference of popular times.

## Duration Analysis
Next, we review the most popular times for a ride and determining the best times of day for rides, as well as when the bikes will be returned to the stations. By determining the times and dates of rides, we can determine when to repair the bikes.

## Bikes in Need
The final slide shows that we have several bikes that are more popular than others. I would recommend determining where the most popular bikes are located (start and end) and determining if multiple stations in the same location are warranted. I would then review population trends by using the census data located in Tableau and determine the most profitable new locations in the same area while simultaneously removing bike stations that are not as profitable.
